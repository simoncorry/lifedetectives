                    <p>I believe the Life Detectives programme is extremely important and an impressive material which would be of enormous benefit to a wide number of people in the community. The material is research based, firmly rooted in personal experience and anecdotes and delivered in an entertaining and attractive way. I very much hope that these important truths and principles can be disseminated to as wide a group of people as possible.</p>

                    	<h2>The Work You’re Born to Do</h2>
                        <p>When we are looking for our first career or even a change of career we usually begin by looking at jobs. But this is the wrong way round. Somewhere there is an area of work that is just made for you. It fits your personality, uses your strengths and confirms your values. It may not be the job you first think of. It may not match the subjects you were good at in school or college – but it matches you perfectly.</p>
                        <p>So to find the right work you first have to know yourself. Then you can understand the feelings that really satisfying work gives you. Only then can you write the job description form heaven and start looking for a job to match it.</p>
                        <p>Whether you want a new job or to make more of the one you have, contact us now and write the job description from heaven.</p>

                    	<h2>Renewing Your Relationship</h2>
                        <p>The right attitude, good relationships and a meaning in life: these are the three main ingredients for lasting happiness.</p>
                        <p>Good relationships are based on good communication; the oxygen of a relationship. This course will show you how to talk without talking down and listen without feeling criticised. Be assertive without being aggressive.</p>
                        <p>No two people are alike. To relate properly we need to learn how to celebrate our differences and not just put up with them. Relationships are not give and take. They are give and give. Learn the art of win-win.</p>
                        <p>This course is not just for spouses and partners. You can use it to improve all your relationships; siblings, parents, friends, teachers and co-workers – in fact any one you meet, however fleetingly. Get a happier life – call us for details.</p>

                        <p>You get the man you ask for. Where you go, what you wear and what you do and say are a huge advert for the man you want.  Are you advertising for worms?</p>
                        <p>This light-hearted (but effective) guide will show you what kind of signals you’re really giving out and why you attract the moths instead of the good guys. Remember, you get what you ask for so make sure you’re asking for what you really want. Make sure you send the right signals and you’ll get the right man.</p>

                        <p>Clothes are more than just covering. How you dress says a lot about you. Is it telling the truth?  Discover your true personal style and how to create it in the clothes you wear.</p>
                        <p>We start by looking at your body image – what you think you look like. We’ll spend some time on discovering and refining your personal style – how you want to be seen and what you’re doing to present that image.</p>
                        <p>This short course starts on the inside because before you even look at clothes you need to take a good look at yourself.If you sometimes feel your clothes are wearing you, contact us to find out how you can get that look you’ve always wanted.</p>

                    <h1>The Life Detective's story</h1>
                    <hr class="green" />
                    <p>Life Detectives was born out of trauma and frustration.</p>
                    <p>In one short season my daughter left home, my favourite cat died and I had a recall notice from the cancer screen. It was the end of an era and looked like being the end.</p>
                    <p>I was a trained social worker and a bereavement counsellor and I didn't have the tools to cope. All my experience and training took me back into the past while I wanted reassurance that there was a future. I looked at the self help stuff but that was all about changing "in a heartbeat" - forget the past - set the goals and go for it. None of it told me why I was feeling like there was no future to set goals for or what to do about it.</p>
                    <p>And so began the search and the study; a degree in psychology, diplomas in life coaching, Transactional Analysis, and NLP; a City and Guilds Certificate in adult teaching, another in interior design and even a City and Guilds in Barista Skills (for fun).</p>
                    <p>I love detective stories and watching how clues in the present can reconstruct what happened in the past.</p>
                    <p>Put them all togther with over 15 years' counselling experience and you have – The Life Detectives.</p>

                    <p>My wife and I planned a new life in Devon. Then she was diagnosed
            with cancer and died seven months later. I was very lucky indeed to be given
            Anne's phone number. I learned many things about myself and why I am the
            person I am today - as well as being reassured that my grief for my wife was
            normal. Once I would have said I don't need coaching but now I know that
            it can make a huge difference.</p>
